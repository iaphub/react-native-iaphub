We've simplified in-app purchases for you. Say goodbye to wasting time and resources reinventing the wheel.<br/>
At [IAPHUB](https://www.iaphub.com), we've developed all the necessary tools for selling in-app purchases and subscriptions, managing your customers, and boosting your revenue. 🚀
<br/>

## Getting Started

Please refer to our [Quickstart Guide](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/getting-started/?sdk=react_native) for step-by-step instructions on integrating IAPHUB into your React Native app.

You can also learn all about our SDK methods in our comprehensive [SDK Reference](https://www.iaphub.com/docs/sdk-reference/?sdk=react_native).

## UI

The package provides all the methods of the IAPHUB SDK for easy implementation of in-app purchases, but it does not include any user interface (UI).
If you prefer a plug-and-play component with built-in UI, consider exploring [react-native-iaphub-ui](https://github.com/iaphub/react-native-iaphub-ui).

## Upgrades

If you're upgrading to a new major version of the plugin, please consult our migration guides:
- For transitioning from v7.X.X to v8.X.X, refer to [this guide](https://github.com/iaphub/react-native-iaphub/tree/master/guides/migrate-v7-to-v8.md).
